# Sorting Hat Image Setup

## Required Image: hat.jpeg

To enable the spinning hat animation at the start of the ceremony, you need to add a sorting hat image to the assests folder.

### Image Requirements:
- **Filename**: `hat.jpeg` (or `hat.jpg`)
- **Location**: Place it in the `assests` folder
- **Recommended size**: At least 300x300 pixels
- **Format**: JPEG
- **Content**: An image of the Hogwarts Sorting Hat

### Where to Find a Hat Image:
1. Search for "Hogwarts Sorting Hat" images online
2. Use an AI image generator to create one
3. Download from a Harry Potter fan site
4. Create your own artistic rendering

### What Happens Without the Image:
If `hat.jpeg` is not found in the assests folder, the program will automatically use a large hat emoji (🎩) as a fallback, which will still spin but won't look as authentic.

### Installation:
1. Download or create your sorting hat image
2. Save it as `hat.jpeg`
3. Place it in: `E:\HP Game\assests\hat.jpeg`
4. Run the program again

The hat will now spin majestically in the center of the screen for 3 seconds before revealing "The Official Sorting Ceremony" title!
